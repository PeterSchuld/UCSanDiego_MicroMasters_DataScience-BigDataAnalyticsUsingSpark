# UC San Diego MicroMasters Data Science "Big Data Analytics Using Spark"
Part 4 of Data Science MicroMastersÂ® Program on edX. DES230 "Big Data Analytics Using Spark" by Yoav Freund, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering UC San Diego. Learn how to analyze large datasets using Jupyter notebooks, MapReduce and Spark as a platform.

About this course

In data science, data is called "big" if it cannot fit into the memory of a single standard laptop or workstation. The analysis of big datasets requires using a cluster of tens, hundreds or thousands of computers. Effectively using such clusters requires the use of distributed files systems, such as the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and corresponding computational models, such as Hadoop, MapReduce and Spark. In this course, part of the Data Science MicroMasters program, you will learn what the bottlenecks are in massive parallel computation and how to use spark to minimize these bottlenecks. You will learn how to perform supervised an unsupervised machine learning on massive datasets using the Machine Learning Library (MLlib).

In this course, as in the other ones in this MicroMasters program, you will gain hands-on experience using PySpark within the Jupyter notebooks environment.

What you'll learn


    Programming Spark using Pyspark
    Identifying the computational tradeoffs in a Spark application
    Performing data loading and cleaning using Spark and Parquet
    Modeling data through statistical and machine learning methods
